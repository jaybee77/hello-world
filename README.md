# hello-world

Sadly, the extent of my programming amounts to one javascript course 12 years ago. I've rcently become facinated with the world of Raspberry Pi and Node-RED. I have minimal html experience. Basically I'm a dabbler/ tinkerer!... I am looking forward to learning more and taking my Pi experiments to the next level!
